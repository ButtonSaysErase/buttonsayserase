### The fuck you doing here???
My name is Max and I'm "working" on stuff. What is that stuff? You tell me I switch it up every day since I can't stay on one item lmao

I only have two socials, mastodon and discord, which are below. There is Twitter but I only use that to post images and videos from my switch and 3ds.

- *Mastodon:* [@erase@banana.dog](https://banana.dog/@erase)

- *Discord:* erase#2908
